# Rental_market_italy
This project is aimed to analyse the rental market of the 20 largest cities in Italy and to help me to practice my data science skills with a raw dataset. 

### First phase - Web scraping
The first file uploaded is a Python script in which I used the library Selenium in order to collect data using a web scraping technique.

The script is able to scrape multiple pages from the Italian real estate website Immobiliare.it. I checked with robots.txt whether some information of my interest is allowed to scrape or not, and I didn't find any block.

The information I collected are: title, price, rooms, surface, n_toilettes, floor.
The information is stored in a csv file.
